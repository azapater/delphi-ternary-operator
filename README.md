# Delphi Ternary Operator Demo

A console application demonstrating the new ternary operator (if-then-else expression) introduced in Delphi, highlighting its differences from `ifThen` and showcasing its capabilities.

## Overview

This demo includes 8 examples that illustrate:

- Basic usage and syntax
- String expressions and function calls
- Operator precedence
- Short-circuit evaluation (key difference from `ifThen`)
- Returning any type (objects, records, anonymous methods)
- Type compatibility rules
- Nested ternary operators
- Real-world usage examples

## Key Differences from ifThen

- **Short-circuit evaluation**: Only evaluates the selected branch
- **Any type support**: Works with objects, records, anonymous methods, and more
- **Expression context**: Can be used directly in any expression
- **Pascal-like syntax**: Uses familiar `if-then-else` syntax

## Requirements

- Delphi 13 or later (supports the ternary operator)

## Usage

Compile and run the console application to see all demos in action.
